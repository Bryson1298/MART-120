GitHub's GUI is a far more convenient option as it primarily deals with visual elements such as buttons and menus, which make the tasks intuitive and accessible even for a novice user. On the other hand, the command-line interface is much thinner and depends only on text inputs, which makes it very difficult for a beginner to get the hang of it. GitHub's GUI makes things like repository viewing and pull request management easier, while the Git CLI is quicker and more flexible, allowing for greater control over advanced workflows and automation.
