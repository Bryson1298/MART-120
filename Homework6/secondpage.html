      Attack on Titan is a dark fantasy story following Eren Yeager, who vows to
      eradicate man-eating giants (Titans) after they breach his city's walls
      and kill his mother. He joins the Survey Corps to fight back, eventually
      discovering the Titans are actually transformed humans, and the war is a
      complex, political battle against another nation.
