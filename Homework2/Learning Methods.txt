People use visual learning methods while auditory learning methods and hands-on learning approaches to study material. I believe that learning styles do impact our learning process but their effects do not follow the strict patterns which people typically assume. People have their own preferred learning methods yet they can achieve successful learning results through different methods of instruction. Learning styles affect people through their learning styles because they create situations which give people more pleasure and interest in learning activities.


The most effective learning method requires different learning styles to be used together as teaching materials. A student needs to see a diagram and practice using that information to achieve better understanding of a concept. I have noticed that when instruction aligns with my preferred learning methods I tend to stay more focused and motivated which improves my understanding. The use of one specific style for learning becomes a restrictive force that restricts all learning activities. People need to develop the ability to learn through various teaching methods since real-life situations require them to learn from content that does not follow standard presentation methods. The importance of learning styles exists but our learning success depends more on our ability to adapt and our commitment to studying.
